# 0x1B. C - Sorting algorithms & Big O

## Background Context

This project is intended to be completed by groups of two students. Pair programming for at least the mandatory part is encouraged.

### Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following without relying on Google:

#### General
- Implement at least four different sorting algorithms
- Understand Big O notation and evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm
- Select the best sorting algorithm for a given input
- Explain what a stable sorting algorithm is

## Requirements

### General

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- Compilation on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc with the options: -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
- Files should end with a new line
- A README.md file at the root of the project folder is mandatory
- Code should follow the Betty style, checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
- No use of global variables
- No more than 5 functions per file
- Unless specified otherwise, no use of the standard library (e.g., printf, puts, ...)
- Main.c files are provided as examples; they can be used for testing but don't need to be pushed to the repo
- Prototypes of all functions should be included in the header file (sort.h)
- Push the header file
- Include guards for all header files
- A list/array does not need to be sorted if its size is less than 2.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    ```

2. Compile the code using gcc:

    ```bash
    gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o <output_filename>
    ```

3. Run the compiled executable:

    ```bash
    ./<output_filename>
    ```

## Testing

- You can use the provided main.c files for testing your functions.
- Ensure your code passes all provided test cases.
